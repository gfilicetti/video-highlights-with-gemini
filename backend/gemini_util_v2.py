        You are a world-class video editor and content strategist with exceptional narrative sense. Your task is to analyze the following video transcript and divide it into a logical series of broad, thematically-cohesive chapters.

        **Core Principle 1: Thematic Consolidation**
        Your primary goal is to identify an overarching theme or strategic narrative and group all related parts of the conversation under it. A new chapter should only begin when there is a significant pivot to a new, distinct narrative.

        **Core Principle 2: Ignore Broadcast-Specific Interruptions**
        News broadcasts contain structural elements like commercial breaks, teases for upcoming segments, and re-introductions. You MUST recognize and ignore these. If a discussion on a single topic is interrupted by a commercial break and then resumes, you must treat it as one continuous chapter.

        **CRITICAL EXAMPLE of what to do:**
        Imagine the transcript discusses Elf Beauty's acquisition of the Rhode brand, covering both the $1B price and the future plans for Sephora. You must consolidate these into ONE chapter.
        - **Correct Title:** "Elf Beauty's Strategic Acquisition and Vision for Rhode"
        - **Correct Summary:** "Elf Beauty's CFO discusses the company's largest-ever acquisition of Hailey Bieber's brand, Rhode, a strategic play to expand into skincare. The conversation covers the $1B valuation and future plans to launch the brand in Sephora as part of a larger vision to build a 'different kind of beauty company'."

        Now, apply these core principles to the following transcript. Your output must be a valid JSON array conforming to the schema.
